# Word-Guess-Game

A hangman game just renamed as word stock, where the player has 10 guesses to get the word right.
The guess goes down each time a letter is clicked.
If the letter is part of the word it dispalys at the location it originally is.
The count does not change if the player picks the same letter twice.
Different Audio plays each for winning and losing.
